Fredrick Salm : So, where are you off to now? The gym again?
Cassandra Salm : Yeah, my trainer is pushing me really hard in all sorts of ways.
Cassandra Salm : He said that he wanted to see me every night this week.
Fredrick Salm : Alright, should I bother waiting up tonight?
Cassandra Salm : I wouldn’t, hun. I’ll probably just crash at his place.
Fredrick Salm : Alright, Cassandra. Have a good time working out.
Cassandra Salm : You know I always do! Goodnight, Fred.

ABRA : Automatic pathing set to spleen. Activating drives.
ABRA : There we go. We’ll arrive at our first destination momentarily, my child.
ABRA : Current location - Spleen.

ABRA : We’re here to do just that.
ABRA : I need you to acquire some red blood cells so we can get strong enough to do what must be done!
ABRA : I know you can do this.
